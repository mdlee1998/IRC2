The R scripts must run in the following order:

GetLibrarties.R
ManipulateData.R
CreatePlots.R

If CreatePlots needs to be rerun ManipulateData should also be ran first,
otherwise the plots will get altered and not appear right.

The python script ended up not being heavily used for the final 
product, but is included anyways.
